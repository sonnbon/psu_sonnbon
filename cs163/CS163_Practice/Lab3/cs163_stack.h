//In Lab #3 we will be working with the journal class from Lab #2 (where the code

//extend it by creating a stack of journals. The data structure will be a 
//linear linked list of arrays of dynamicaly allocated journal entries

//point to one item or the first of many items

//data and push (add at the beginning), pop (remove at the beginning), 
//display all, and peek (retrieve the information at the beginning).

//Create arrays of const size MAX
const int MAX = 5;
