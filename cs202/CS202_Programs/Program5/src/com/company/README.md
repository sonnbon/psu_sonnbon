<h1>Food Menu Builder</h1>

This project was part of a split between two final assignments in the CS202 course at Portland State University (labeled as Program 4/5). These final projects were used in a way to immerse ourselves into using a new program, Java, after using C++ the entire term. It pushed us to learn a new language fast, using the skills we gained along the way.
In this project, a user can build a menu of food items and then subsequently order food from that menu. A user can also load food items directly into a menu from an externai text file. Users can add, search, remove, and edit food item attributes. The way in which a menu is created is also up to the user. Program 4 and Program 5 use different data structures for the purpose of teaching us how to use built-in data structures and balanced binary search trees within a brand new language.

This program was runnable through the IntelliJ IDEA application.
