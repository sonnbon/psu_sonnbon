<h1>Olympic Athlete Tracker</h1>
This project was a part of the CS202 course at Portland State University. This application allows a user to manage different collections of athletes competing in specific competitions in the Winter Olympics. This application will allow a user to add, search for, and display athlete information and their competition statistics. Of the three competition types, figure skating athletes are sorted alphabetically. The purpose of this application is to test and use operator overloading to achieve managing these three different types of athletes. The user can also choose to test specific athlete classes for full functionality, that which might not be included in the main application.

This project was implemented using C++.
