#include "cs162_list.h"


//These are the functions to implement for this lab
//Like Lab9, we are not using clases here

//Check to see if the desired item is in the list
//Return true if it is found

//We are also practicing with returning values; make
//sure to return values from your functions and use
//those returned values in main!

//Step 2 - Practice Traversal
int display_first_and_last(node * head)
{

           //Write your code here
}

//Step 3 - Practice Insertion
bool insert_before_last(node * & head, int to_add)
{
           //Write our code here
}

//Step 4 - Practice Removal
int remove_first_two(node * & head)
{
          //Write your code here
}


//Challenge - Make a complete copy  of the entire LLL creating
//a completely new LLL
void copy_all(node * & destination_head, node * source_head)
{
          //Write your code here

}
